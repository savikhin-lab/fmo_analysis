# Scripts

This is a collection of tools that I wrote for myself when I needed to investigate something, run a profiler, etc and didn't want to just throw away the tool I made for myself. The tools cannot be run from their current location, they are just put here for organizational purposes. Unless otherwise mentioned, then probably need to be put at the root of the `fmo_analysis` package before running since they'll probably import the `fmo_analysis` package as part of whatever task the tool is running.
